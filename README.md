# Termux
Me learning linux command line in Termux on android, all on my phone

I learned the complicated way to compile and run a java file in Termux, then I learned how to simplify all that by writing a makefile, then I learned how to create a git repository and push that repo to github, and here we are. Not bad for an hour on my phone.
